# BasicVideoClassification
As a part of the Computer Vision Course lab in Afeka College, I`ve processed data for Video Classification and trained a Resnet50 for the task, using an Early Fusion strategy. The model was trained on the UCF-101 dataset for action recognition.
We only used the Basketball, Biking, Diving, PizzaTossing and RopeClimbing videos.
